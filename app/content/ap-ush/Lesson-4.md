## Causes of Revolution

### Taxation Without Representation
The Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, and other taxes caused outrage. Colonists had no representation in Parliament and argued these taxes violated their rights.

### British Military Presence
Stationing troops in cities, including Boston, intensified tensions and contributed to events like the Boston Massacre.

### Colonial Resistance
- Boycotts of British goods
- Formation of Committees of Correspondence
- Propaganda such as pamphlets and newspapers to unite colonists

## Declaration of Independence (1776)
Drafted primarily by Thomas Jefferson, it declared independence from Britain. Key points:
- All men are created equal
- Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
- Governments derive power from the consent of the governed
