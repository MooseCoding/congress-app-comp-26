## Causes of the Civil War

### Slavery
Northern and Southern states clashed over slavery’s expansion into new territories. 
The Southern economy relied heavily on enslaved labor, while the North increasingly opposed it.

### States' Rights
Southern states emphasized their right to govern themselves, including maintaining the institution of slavery.

### Political Compromises
- Missouri Compromise (1820)
- Compromise of 1850
- Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)

Each temporarily eased tensions but ultimately failed to prevent conflict.
