# Lesson 4: Electricity and Circuits

## Introduction
Electricity is the study of charged particles and their interactions. Circuits are systems that allow charges to flow in a controlled manner, powering devices and performing work. Understanding electricity requires mastery of **current**, **voltage**, **resistance**, and **energy transfer**.

---

## Charge and Current

### Electric Charge
- Fundamental property of matter.
- Comes in two types: positive and negative.
- Like charges repel, opposite charges attract.

### Electric Current
- Flow of electric charge through a conductor.
- Measured in amperes (A): 1 ampere = 1 coulomb per second.

### Conventional Current vs Electron Flow
- Conventional: flows from positive to negative.
- Actual electron flow: from negative to positive.

---

## Voltage and Potential Difference
- Voltage is the energy per unit charge.
- Provides the “push” that drives current in a circuit.
- Measured in volts (V).

**Example:**  
A 9V battery provides 9 joules of energy per coulomb of charge.

---

## Resistance and Ohm’s Law
- Resistance opposes current flow.
- Ohm’s Law: \( V = I R \)
  - V: voltage (volts)
  - I: current (amperes)
  - R: resistance (ohms)

### Factors Affecting Resistance
- Material: conductors vs insulators
- Length and cross-sectional area of conductor
- Temperature

---

## Circuit Types

### Series Circuits
- Components connected one after another.
- Current is the same through all components.
- Total resistance: \( R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \)

### Parallel Circuits
- Components connected across same voltage points.
- Voltage is the same across each branch.
- Total resistance: \( \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \)

### Mixed Circuits
- Combination of series and parallel.
- Requires careful analysis using Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Rules.

---

## Energy in Circuits
- Electrical work: \( W = Q V \)
- Power: \( P = V I \)
- Energy is transformed from electrical to light, heat, or mechanical energy.

**Example:**  
A 60 W lightbulb at 120 V draws 0.5 A of current: \( P = V I = 120 × 0.5 = 60 W \)

---

## Safety Considerations
- Short circuits cause excessive current; can lead to fires.
- Grounding prevents electrical shocks.
- Fuses and circuit breakers interrupt dangerous currents.

---

## Applications
- Batteries and power supplies provide voltage.
- Resistors, capacitors, and inductors control current and voltage.
- Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion.

---

## Summary
Mastering electricity and circuits is fundamental to modern technology. Analyzing simple and complex circuits, understanding energy transfer, and applying Ohm’s law are essential skills for future physics topics in electromagnetism and electronics.
