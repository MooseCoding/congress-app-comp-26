# Lesson 8: Waves and Modern Physics

## Introduction
Waves transfer energy without transferring matter. Understanding waves is essential for topics from sound to light and quantum phenomena.

## Wave Properties

- **Wavelength**: Distance between peaks.
- **Frequency**: Number of oscillations per second.
- **Amplitude**: Maximum displacement.
- **Speed**: v = frequency Ã— wavelength

### Types of Waves
- **Mechanical**: Require a medium (sound, water)
- **Electromagnetic**: Do not require a medium (light, radio)

## Modern Physics Concepts

- **Photoelectric Effect**: Light can release electrons from metals, showing particle-like behavior.
- **Relativity**: Motion near the speed of light affects time and length.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Energy levels are discrete; particles have wave-like properties.

## Summary
Understanding waves bridges classical and modern physics. It sets the stage for analyzing energy transfer, light, sound, and foundational quantum ideas.
