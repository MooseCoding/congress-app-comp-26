# Lesson 1: Mechanics Basics

## Introduction
Mechanics is the branch of physics that studies **motion and forces**. Understanding mechanics allows us to predict and describe the behavior of objects, from rolling balls to planets orbiting the sun. Mechanics is divided into **kinematics** (describing motion) and **dynamics** (explaining motion through forces).

## Kinematics

### Position and Displacement
- **Position** indicates where an object is located relative to a reference point.
- **Displacement** measures the change in position from initial to final, including direction. Unlike distance, displacement is a vector quantity.

**Example:**  
A runner moves 100 meters east, then 50 meters west.  
- Distance traveled: 150 meters  
- Displacement: 50 meters east

### Velocity
- Velocity measures the rate of change of displacement.
- Includes **speed** and **direction**.  
- Average velocity: \( v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \)  
- Instantaneous velocity: velocity at a specific moment in time.

**Example:**  
A car moves 120 km north in 2 hours. Average velocity = 60 km/h north.

### Acceleration
- Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity: \( a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \)
- Positive acceleration increases speed; negative acceleration (deceleration) decreases speed.
- Acceleration can also represent a change in direction without changing speed (circular motion).

**Example:**  
A car going from 0 to 20 m/s in 4 seconds has an acceleration of 5 m/s².

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law (Law of Inertia)
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.  
- **Inertia** is the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion.

### Second Law
Force equals mass times acceleration: \( F = m a \)  
- Explains how the motion of an object changes when forces act on it.
- Direction of force is the same as direction of acceleration.

**Example:**  
A 10 kg cart experiences a 50 N push. Acceleration = 50 ÷ 10 = 5 m/s²

### Third Law
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
- Forces always come in pairs.  
- Explains phenomena like rocket propulsion and walking.

## Forces

### Gravitational Force
- Every object with mass attracts every other object.
- Near Earth's surface: \( F_g = m g \), with \( g \approx 9.8 \text{ m/s²} \)

### Friction
- Opposes motion between surfaces.
- Static friction prevents motion; kinetic friction opposes motion in progress.

### Tension
- Force transmitted through ropes, cables, or strings.
- Always pulls along the rope toward the object.

### Normal Force
- Perpendicular contact force exerted by a surface on an object.

---

## Free-Body Diagrams
- Visual representation of all forces acting on an object.
- Essential for solving dynamics problems.

**Example:**  
A box on an inclined plane: draw gravity downward, normal perpendicular to the slope, friction up or down the slope depending on motion.

---

## Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)
1. \( v = v_0 + a t \)  
2. \( x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \)  
3. \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a (x - x_0) \)

---

## Work, Energy, and Power

### Work
- Work = Force × displacement × cos(θ)
- Only forces along displacement do work.

### Kinetic Energy
- \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)

### Potential Energy
- Gravitational: \( PE = m g h \)

### Conservation of Energy
- Total energy in an isolated system remains constant.
- \( KE_{initial} + PE_{initial} = KE_{final} + PE_{final} \)

### Power
- Rate at which work is done: \( P = \frac{W}{t} \)

## Summary
Mechanics provides the foundation for all physics. Understanding kinematics, forces, and energy allows us to predict and analyze physical phenomena in both everyday life and advanced applications.
