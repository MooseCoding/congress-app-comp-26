# Lesson 1: Introduction to Rhetorical Analysis

## Objective
Understand how authors use **ethos, pathos, and logos** to persuade audiences, and learn to analyze stylistic and structural choices in texts.

---

## Rhetorical Appeals

### Ethos (Credibility)
- Establishing authority and trustworthiness.
- Example: A doctor discussing health research builds credibility.

### Pathos (Emotion)
- Appeals to audience emotions.
- Example: A charity ad showing suffering animals to invoke empathy.

### Logos (Logic)
- Appeals to reason and evidence.
- Example: Statistics, data, and logical arguments.

## Stylistic Devices
- **Diction:** Word choice affects tone and meaning.
- **Syntax:** Sentence structure influences pacing and emphasis.
- **Imagery and Figurative Language:** Metaphors, similes, and analogies clarify or amplify meaning.
- **Tone:** The author’s attitude toward the subject.

---

## Reading and Annotating
1. Read the text carefully.
2. Highlight appeals (ethos, pathos, logos).
3. Identify rhetorical strategies (diction, tone, evidence).
4. Note how structure and style contribute to the author’s purpose.

## Sample Analysis
Text excerpt: *"As a teacher with twenty years of experience, I have seen the impact of early literacy programs..."*  
- **Ethos:** Establishes expertise.  
- **Logos:** Refers to observable results in classrooms.  
- **Pathos:** Evokes concern for children’s education.

---

## Practice Exercise
- Select a short editorial.
- Identify at least 3 examples of rhetorical appeals.
- Annotate the text explaining why the author used them.

## Summary
Rhetorical analysis requires careful attention to **author, audience, purpose, and strategies**. Recognizing appeals and devices prepares you for both multiple-choice and essay questions on the AP exam.
